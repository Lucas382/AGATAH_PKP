# AGATAH_PKP
Using Python, Kivy and PostgreSQL to make a virtual assistant
this is my personal project to help me improve my skills and 
support my daily tasks.

Plans:
    Daily task management with calendar and alarms.
    Automatic start and stop configurable Pomodoro.
    Virtual assistant with voice command to set timers(initially).
